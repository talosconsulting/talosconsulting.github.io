## Invested in You. 🚀
At Talos, we don't just offer "perks"—we provide the infrastructure for a high-performance life and long-term wealth.

## High-Efficiency, High-Comp ⚡
We’ve engineered Talos to be lean. By eliminating the heavy overhead and bloated management layers of traditional firms, we redirect that capital where it belongs--your compensation:
* High Speed, Low Drag: Our lean operational model allows us to offer compensation packages that outpace the industry standard. 🏎️
* 10% Direct 401(k) Funding: A 10% non-elective contribution. No matching required, no hoops to jump through. 🏦
* The Mega Backdoor Roth: Our retirement plan is purpose-built to bypass standard contribution ceilings. By supporting [After-Tax contributions and in-plan conversions](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/mega-backdoor-roth), we enable you to funnel tens of thousands more into permanent tax-free growth than the standard IRS limit allows. 💰

## Platinum-Grade Health 🏥
Your well-being shouldn't have a price tag:
* $0 Deductible, Platinum Healthcare: 100% company-funded Anthem Platinum PPO. You pay nothing out of pocket. 🩺
* Total Coverage: 100% company-funded Dental (Delta Dental) and Vision (Anthem). 😁+🤓

## Uncompromising Growth & Balance ⚖️
Everyone requires scheduled downtime. We offer a benefits package designed to ensure you’re as rested as you are rewarded:
* **5.5 Weeks PTO**: We work hard, but we reset harder. Take the time you need. ✈︎
* **$4,000 Annual Training Budget**: A dedicated budget and 40 hours of paid leave to sharpen your technical tradecraft. 🥷
* **$1,500 Tech Stipend**: New gear every two years. We want you working on the best hardware available. 💻
* **$5,000 Referral Bonus**: Grow the team and get paid. 🤑
